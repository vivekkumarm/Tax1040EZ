                                <h3>Earned Income Credit:</h3>
                                The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a financial boost for people working hard to make ends meet. Millions of workers may qualify for the first time this year due to changes in their marital, parental or financial status.<br />
                                <br />
                                The IRS urges workers, self-employed people and farmers earning $51,567 or less in 2013 to see if they qualify by using the EITC Assistant on IRS.gov. To get the credit taxpayers need to file a return and specifically claim the EITC, even if they aren’t required to file.<br />
                                <br />

                                <h3>Credit Limits for Tax-Year 2013 </h3>
                                The EITC varies based on income and family size. The table showing credit amounts can be found in the Instruction booklets for Forms 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ and in Publication 596, Earned Income Credit. This includes the expanded benefit for families with three or more children.<br />
                                <br />

                                Those who qualify for EITC for tax year 2013 can get a credit from:<br />
                                <ul>
                                    <li>$2 to $487 with no qualifying children;</li>
                                    <li>$9 to $3,250 with one qualifying child;</li>
                                    <li>$10 to $5,372 with two qualifying children;</li>
                                    <li>$11 to $6,044 with three or more qualifying children.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Rules for every taxpayer:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Must have earned income, such as wages, tips or the income from running a business or farm. Most other types of income, such as retirement pensions, though usually taxable, do not count as earned income;</li>
                                    <li>Must have a Social Security number that is valid for employment for self, spouse and any qualifying children;</li>
                                    <li>A person can get the credit even with a small amount of investment income, such as interest from a bank account. However, the amount of investment income is limited to $3,300;</li>
                                    <li>The filing status used must be single, head of household, married filing jointly or qualifying widow or widower. A taxpayer who files as married filing separately cannot get the credit;</li>
                                    <li>Generally, must be either a U.S. citizen or resident alien;</li>
                                    <li>Cannot be a qualifying child of another person;</li>
                                    <li>Cannot file Form 2555 or Form 2555-EZ. These forms are used to claim the foreign earned income exclusion, a tax benefit for Americans who live and work abroad</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>In addition, income must be below certain amounts. For tax year 2013, both earned income and adjusted gross income (AGI) must each be less than:</h3>
